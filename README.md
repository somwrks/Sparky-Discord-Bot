## Description:
    
This Discord bot uses the LangChain library to create a question-answering system.
It uses the Hugging Face Hub to download pre-trained models and embeddings,
and integrates with the Qdrant vector database for efficient search.
The bot also supports multi-step reasoning, allowing users to ask questions
that require multiple pieces of information from different sources. It also lists the citations used for the information

The bot also supports natural language inference (NLI) using the
Google Generative AI model. To use NLI, you must provide a
question and two options, and the bot will generate a third option
that is most likely to be the correct answer.

The current use for this bot is to provide answers to questions regarding arizona state university 

## Technical Workflow

![Untitled-2024-06-20-0039](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7df755a4-fc82-4d48-8a47-b573f36de33f)


- The bot starts by connecting to the Qdrant vector database.
- It then retrieves relevant documents from the database using the ASU University's search terms.
- The bot uses the Hugging Face pipeline to generate answers based on the retrieved documents.
- If a user asks a question that requires multi-step reasoning, the bot will generate a series of answers, each based on the previous one.
- To handle natural language inference (NLI), the bot uses the Google Generative AI model.
- The bot is designed to handle a variety of questions related to ASU University, such as academic information, campus life, and student life.
