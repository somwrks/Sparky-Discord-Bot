    "## Description:\n",
    "    \n",
    "This Discord bot uses the LangChain library to create a question-answering system.\n",
    "It uses the Hugging Face Hub to download pre-trained models and embeddings,\n",
    "and integrates with the Qdrant vector database for efficient search.\n",
    "The bot also supports multi-step reasoning, allowing users to ask questions\n",
    "that require multiple pieces of information from different sources. It also lists the citations used for the information\n",
    "\n",
    "The bot also supports natural language inference (NLI) using the\n",
    "Google Generative AI model. To use NLI, you must provide a\n",
    "question and two options, and the bot will generate a third option\n",
    "that is most likely to be the correct answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The current use for this bot is to provide answers to questions regarding arizona state university \n",

    "## Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "- The bot starts by connecting to the Qdrant vector database.\n",
    "- It then retrieves relevant documents from the database using the ASU University's search terms.\n",
    "- The bot uses the Hugging Face pipeline to generate answers based on the retrieved documents.\n",
    "- If a user asks a question that requires multi-step reasoning, the bot will generate a series of answers, each based on the previous one.\n",
    "- To handle natural language inference (NLI), the bot uses the Google Generative AI model.\n",
    "- The bot is designed to handle a variety of questions related to ASU University, such as academic information, campus life, and student life.\n",

A rolling deadline means that applications will continue to be reviewed on a regular basis until the semester begins. International students should be mindful of visa deadlines to ensure there is time to produce necessary visa documents. Applicants are encouraged to complete and submit application materials as soon as possible for consideration. A final deadline means that all applications and application materials must be received by Graduate Admissions by the deadline date. Applications that are incomplete may not be considered after the final deadline. Applications that are submitted past the final deadline may not be considered. A priority deadline means that applications submitted and completed before the priority deadline will receive priority consideration. Applications submitted after the priority deadlines will be reviewed in the order in which they were completed and on a space available basis. An application is complete after all materials are received by Graduate Admissions. The 24-Month STEM OPT Extension is an additional benefit from United States Citizenship and Immigration Services that allows international students in F-1 status who receive a bachelor’s, master’s, or doctoral degree in an approved STEM field to apply for a 24-month extension of their standard 12-month Post-OPT period, twice in a lifetime. This allows international students the opportunity to gain additional off-campus work experience in their field of study after completion of course studies and Post-OPT.

A minor is an approved, coherent focus of academic study in a single discipline, other than the student's major, involving substantially fewer hours of credit than a corresponding major. Certain major and minor combinations may be deemed inappropriate either by the college or department of the major or minor. This is only the first required math course. This program may contain additional math courses; See Major Map for details. The level of intensity represents a measure of the number and academic rigor of math courses required.

MAT 266, MAT 267, MAT 270, MAT 271, MAT 272, MAT 274, MAT 275 Students pursuing concurrent degrees earn two distinct degrees and receive two diplomas. ASU offers students two ways to earn concurrent degrees: by choosing a predetermined combination or creating their own combination. Predetermined combinations have a single admissions application and one easy to follow major map. To add a concurrent degree to your existing degree, work with your academic advisor. Either way, concurrent degrees allow students to pursue their own personal or professional interests. Concurrent degree programs are specially designed academic programs which provide high-achieving undergraduate students the opportunity to complete two distinct but complementary bachelor degrees at the same time. Students must meet minimum admissions standards for both programs and be accepted individually by both colleges offering the concurrent program.

A rolling deadline means that applications will continue to be reviewed on a regular basis until the semester begins. International students should be mindful of visa deadlines to ensure there is time to produce necessary visa documents. Applicants are encouraged to complete and submit application materials as soon as possible for consideration. A final deadline means that all applications and application materials must be received by Graduate Admissions by the deadline date. Applications that are incomplete may not be considered after the final deadline. Applications that are submitted past the final deadline may not be considered. A priority deadline means that applications submitted and completed before the priority deadline will receive priority consideration. Applications submitted after the priority deadlines will be reviewed in the order in which they were completed and on a space available basis. An application is complete after all materials are received by Graduate Admissions. The 24-Month STEM OPT Extension is an additional benefit from United States Citizenship and Immigration Services that allows international students in F-1 status who receive a bachelor’s, master’s, or doctoral degree in an approved STEM field to apply for a 24-month extension of their standard 12-month Post-OPT period, twice in a lifetime. This allows international students the opportunity to gain additional off-campus work experience in their field of study after completion of course studies and Post-OPT. The OPT extension does not apply to students completing a degree through ASU Online. All ASU graduate and undergraduate academic programs are fully accredited by the Higher Learning Commission.
